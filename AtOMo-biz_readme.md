# AtOMo-biz readme
<a href="https://blockchainizator.com" target="_blank">Blockchainizator</a> is active for NFTs since 2016 and its AtOMo NFT collection started in 2018.

My initiative 'GenAI for AtOMo product management by Blockchainizator' (shorter: 'AI for AtOMo product management') is
- my use of several LLMs to support core and standard product management activities
- using as example the product AtOMo, an NFT collection started in 2018
- allowing to analyse the pertinence of LLM as tool for product management through a pragmatic use of a real digital product
- shared publicly with comments on social networks

From now (2025) I will share here the core content of 'GenAI for AtOMo product management by Blockchainizator', as markdown files to be read and used by both human and AI systems.
