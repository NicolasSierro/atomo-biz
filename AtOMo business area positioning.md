# AtOMo: Business area & positioning
*blockchainizator internal reference: wave 2 - Dec 2025*

## Business area
AtOMo, as a NFT collection started in 2018, is active in NFTs, within the group of 'historical NFT' for the time period of the 1st NFTs until 2019.
As NFT is a mix of digital content and blockchain token, AtOMo is as well active in these 2 areas:
- digital content: as image (format: jpg or png) or animation (format: gif), with popular culture style (technology, science, geek)
- blockchain: with tokens in limited series, that can be gifted, bought, and sold for source of revenues

## Positioning
Like the majority of early NFT collections until 2019, AtOMo is different than the majority of current ones that are mainly 'Profile Picture' (PFP) NFT collections since the peak of NFTs in 2021, with a lot of them trying to have only short-term success quickly after the launch, and only very few surviving.

AtOMo is oriented for the long term:
- further creating new NFTs in a slow pace
- explaining online his collection's concept and characteristics
- implementation of succession by other persons who will ensure the availability of AtOMO NTFs for the coming decades

Considering sub-groups of digital content, AtOMo is not part of 'digital art' as subset of art, neither of 'Profile Picture' PFP collections, but in the innovative and creative group of content creator pioneers in the digital & technology popular culture (geek, meme, etc.).

The entity behind AtOMo is Blokchainizator managed by Nicolas Sierro.
- Nicolas Sierro is a digital product & project manager who started to be active in NFTs in December 2014 and to create NFTs in October 2016, gaining recognition and credibiltiy in blockchain and historical NFT. He is labelled as NFT artist and listed in NFT directories and marketplace for AtOMo and for other NFTs.
- Blockchainizator presents AtoMo NFTs as its production and provides related services (online words creator, stickers, emojis)
- AtOMo is very different of other NFTs collections with several aspects that are unique, e.g. its kitsch old-fashioned image design, its content images that are free to use under Creative Commons.
