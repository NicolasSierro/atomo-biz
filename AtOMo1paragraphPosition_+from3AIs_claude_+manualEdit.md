# AtOMo Positioning

**AtOMo** is the definitive "Periodic Table on the Blockchain", a pioneering NFT collection that bridges scientific heritage with digital history. Launched in June 2018 on Bitcoin's Counterparty protocol, it stands among the **top 100 earliest NFT collections** globally, representing all 118 elements with distinctive animated artwork long before the mainstream NFT boom.

What makes AtOMo genuinely unique is its **authentic scarcity model**: each element's token supply mirrors its actual abundance on earth and in the universe. The most common elements have thousands of tokens, while the rarest are limited to just a few hundred—creating digital scarcity rooted in physical reality rather than arbitrary numbers.

Beyond the core element collection, it includes creative **"Word NFTs"** that spell words and messages by combining element symbols, appears across multiple blockchain games through cross-collection collaborations, and offers practical tools like Telegram stickers and the AtOMo Speller. Released under **Creative Commons licensing**, the high-resolution visuals are freely available for community use, reflecting a philosophy of open access and long-term cultural value.

Built via Counterparty protocol on **Bitcoin for maximum security** and verified through Wakweli certification, AtOMo appeals to collectors who value historical significance, scientific creativity, and authentic digital culture. It's a high-integrity project for enthusiasts of Bitcoin-native NFTs, geek culture, and the Counterparty ecosystem, offering something genuinely different with proven staying power since the earliest days of digital ownership.
