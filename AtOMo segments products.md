*blockchainizator internal reference: wave 1 - Nov 2025*

## Segments

### Buyer
Current and previous buyers are
- people enjoying blockchain, with preference for Bitcoin
- fan of historical NFTs or of any NFTs on Bitcoin Counterparty (for the majority)

Bitcoin Counterparty is the protocol on top of Bitcoin that allows to create NFTs since 2014, and was used with the 2 major collections Spells of Genesis and Rare Pepe who influenced later the creation of the of the major Cryptopunks collection on Ethereum.

It is highly certain that all buyers of AtOMo are fan of Bitcoin Counterparty and of the top-ten NFT collections on Bitcoin Counterparty, and for sure Spells Genesis or Rare Pepe.

### Prescriber or influencer
People who
- know and like Bitcoin based NFTs
- like digital pop culture (meme, emoji, gaming, geek spirit, etc.)
- own already few or a lot of Bitcoin Counterparty top-ten NFT collections: Spells of Genesis, Rare Pepe, Fake Rare, Fake Commons, Bitcorn crops, Dank directory, Kaleidoscope, etc.
- but did not buy one AtOMo NFT so far

### Remark
For both segments, and potentially new ones, the community aspect to interact online with other people is important
- to get information, improve knowledge, and get insights (it could be as passive mode: not posting a lot, but reading and listening intensively)
- to be part of the groups, the tribes, and having pleasure to interact, socilaise, and share content (active mode)
