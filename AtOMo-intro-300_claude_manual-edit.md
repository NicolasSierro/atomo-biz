# AtOMo NFTs: The Periodic Table on Bitcoin

Before NFTs became mainstream, **Blockchainizator** was already pioneering digital collectibles on the Bitcoin blockchain, since 2016 with Nicolas Sierro's 4 Rare Pepe. Launched on **June 9, 2018**, the **AtOMo collection** represents all 118 elements of the Periodic Table as unique blockchain tokens—recognized today as one of the **top 100 earliest NFT collections** in existence.

## What Makes AtOMo Unique

Unlike typical NFT collections, AtOMo merges science with blockchain innovation. Each element features a distinctive **square tile design** with three animated images showcasing embossed 3D artwork. Background gradient colors differentiate element families, creating both aesthetic appeal and educational value.

The genius lies in the **scarcity model**: token supply reflects each element's physical abundance in the Universe. Hydrogen, the most common element, has 2,112 tokens, while rare elements like Selenium are limited to just 256. This connection between digital scarcity and real-world physics makes AtOMo both conceptually profound and collectible.

## Built on Bitcoin's Foundation

AtOMo lives on **Bitcoin via Counterparty protocol**, offering unparalleled security and immutability compared to newer chains. All assets carry **Wakweli certification**—a decentralized authentication protocol that verifies authenticity and fights fraud, providing collectors with verified provenance rare in the NFT space.

## Beyond Simple Collectibles

The collection extends beyond elements into **Word NFTs**—creative tokens spelling words from element symbols like "No ICO" or "Ho Ho Ho." AtOMo cards appear across multiple blockchain games and collections (Mafia Wars, Bitcorn Crops, Kaleidoscope), demonstrating real cross-platform utility. Tools like the AtOMo Speller, Telegram stickers, and Slack emojis bring these elements into everyday digital communication.

Released under **Creative Commons 4.0**, AtOMo artwork is freely available for commercial use (except new NFT creation), reflecting a philosophy of open access and community empowerment.
